## A React todo app! How original.

This is a simple Todo app created with ReactJS. Each todo item is imported from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos. Because this file contains 200 todo items, the number of displayed items was limited to 10 at a time, in order to avoid clutter. As each item is removed a new item from farther down the list is called to take its place.

All source code can be found at here at my GitHub page.
